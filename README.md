Weather Forecast

Description: This repo allows the user to enter a city and get the current weather conditions, as well as a five day forecast for the selected city. The searched cities are stored in the memory cache and can easily be retrieved instead of typing the city name into the search bar again. This repo was built with html using bootstrap, open weather api, javascript, and CSS.
